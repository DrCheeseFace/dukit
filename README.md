# Git Cli Wrapper for Ducks ðŸ¦†

For the orange\yellow bill inclined amongst us
- Tha goal is a git cli wrapper that does 95% of what you need to do but SUPER slick.
- gota be able to yank text from the terminal with EASE
- This is more a tool i want to use personally so dont expect things to work well for you aswell

## Usage
### Status info
`git status` command (default method) but copy pasteable
```sh
> dukit -b

 Staged
 src/lib.rs

 Modified
 README.md
 src/base_commands.rs

 Untracked
 hi.txt
```
### Branch info 
Notice how easy copy pasting should be 

```sh
> dukit -b

  Your branch is up to date with 'origin/main'.

  feature/git-switch-interactive
  main

```

### Fuzzy branch switching 
```sh
> dukit -f

 #opens fzf
    test2
    test1
â–Œ   feature/git-switch-interactive
  3/3 â”€â”€â”€â”€â”€â”€â”€â”€â”€â”€â”€â”€â”€â”€â”€â”€â”€â”€â”€â”€â”€â”€â”€â”€â”€â”€â”€â”€â”€â”€â”€â”€â”€â”€â”€â”€â”€â”€â”€â”€â”€â”€â”€â”€â”€â”€â”€â”€â”€â”€â”€â”€â”€â”€â”€â”€â”€â”€â”€â”€â”€
> {search bar here}

 Switched to branch 'feature/git-switch-interactive'
```

### Interactive `git add` 
This opens your default editor with files to add

```sh
> dukit -i

# Staged
 out.tape

# -------------------------------------

# Unstaged
[ ] README.md
[ ] .gitignore
[x] demo.gif

# Selected files to be staged like so below V
# [x] file.txt
# Lines begining with (#) will be ignored

> running git add demo.gif
  demo.gif staged

```

### Interactive `git add` via the keys 
allows only upto 26 modified files at once, if more use `duckit -i`
```
Unstaged                     Staged

                             a:  Cargo.lock
s:  Cargo.toml
d:  README.md
                             f:  demo.gif
g:  out.tape
h:  src/duck_commands.rs

> running git add  Cargo.lock
   Cargo.lock Staged
 
  running git add  demo.gif
   demo.gif Staged
```

### Better git log output 
notice how the output is reversed (most recent at the bottom)
